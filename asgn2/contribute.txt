MY CONTRIBUTION
	I wrote the design doc, README, and all code for assignment 2.
	As the sole contributor, I was also responsible for testing
	and compiling the lottery scheduler on my machine.
	
	I implemented a version of lottery scheduling using threads
	to track their ticket and run queues that kept a total ticket
	counter for their threads. I wrote the lottery choosing algorithm
	inside to return the winning thread from a user run queue. The
	algorithm iterates the queue and returns a thread when the ticket
	count exceeds the the random ticket.
	
	I edited the ULE scheduler functions tdq_add and tdq_choose. tdq_add
	checks if thread belongs to a system or user process and places it in
	the appropriate queue. Threads are further sorted by real-time,
	timeshare, and idle classification. tdq_choose checks run queues in
	the following order: real-time, timeshare, and idle. It checks system
	queues before user queues.
	
	I implemented a ticket allocation policy which scales tickets on an
	inverse relation to the priority level. I also wrote another policy
	which scales tickets uniformly across their maximum range for both
	interactive and timeshare threads. I modified the sched_priority()
	function to use these policies, sched_priority() is called by
	multiple functions including sched_nice() which responds to the 
	nice() system call.
