CONTRIBUTION
	As the sole contributor, I was responsible for all source code and
	testing of the project. I wrote the statistics logging for the default
	and modified pageout daemon. I also wrote the modifications to the
	existing pageout daemon that allowed to behave according to the rules
	of the slim chance algorithm.
	
	After gathering statistics from both the default pageout daemon and the
	modified version, I graphed the results in the write-up. The analysis
	and postulation found in the write-up report were also written by me.
	In addition to the write-up, I also authored all other documentation
	including the design document and this README.
