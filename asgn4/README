CONTRIBUTION
	As the sole contributor, I was responsible for all source development
	and unit testing. I wrote source code for protectfile and setkey
	programs and added the setkey() system call to freeBSD.
	
	The protectfile program takes a 16-digit hex key and a filename and
	either encrypts or decrypts the file. The setkey program takes a
	16-digit hex key and adds it to the kernel key table. Alternatively,
	setkey -r is specified to remove an existing key from the key table.
	
	The setkey() system call handles all user requests to add, replace, and
	remove a key. The source code for the setkey() system call is spread
	across multiple files in the kernel source. Full specifications for all
	source code is found in DESIGN.txt.
