1/6/16:
	Computer science revolves around small and large numbers
	Get good at "feeling" these numbers
	Use to ways to guess and answer and cross check
	Learn metric prefixs: kilo, milli, giga, etc.
	
	Estimate things in powers of ten
	Convert powers of two to powers of ten
	
	Computers started with punch cards and grew with tapes
	then came disks which hold more data and allowed concurrent
	processes
	
	Even though multiple programs could run they weren't interative
	until data became cheaper and better managed
	
1/8/16:
	Magnetic discs with sectors on them allow modern programs
	to "virtually" store lots of data
	Discs are really slow!
	
	Memory hiearchy was invented to give the illusion of infinitely
	large and fast memory
	
	Memory at the top (registers) is less then a ns fast while memory at the bottom
	(disc) suffers ms response times
	
	The way data is transfered within the heirarchy is what virtual memory
	is about
	
	Flash Translation Layer (FTL) lets a flash memory mask its internal
	behavior as though it were a disc
	Flash reads or writes in blocks of pages (reads faster than writes)

	Jokes, jokes, jokes
