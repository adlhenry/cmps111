2/22/16:
	Cryptography basics
		algorithms are widely known
		keys should be less widely distributed
		for this to be effective, the ciphertext should be
		the only information that's available to the world
		plaintext is only known to the people with keys (ideal world)
	Secret key encryption
		also called symmetric-key encryption
		monoalphabetic substitution
			each letter replaced by different letter
		vignere cipher
			use a multi-character key
		easy to break
		given encryption key easy to generate decryption key
	Modern encryption algorithms
		Data Encryption Standard (DES)
			uses 56-bit keys
			same key used to encrypt and decrypt
			need 2^55 different keys to guess on average
			for $250K EFF built machine that broke DES quickly
		current algorithms (AES, Blowfish) use at least 128 bit keys
	Unbreakable codes
		one time pad
			uses truly random key as long as message to be encoded
			XOR the message with the key a bit at a time
		code unbreakable because
			key code be anything
			without key, message could be anything with correct number of bits
		distributing key is as hard as distributing message
		difficult to generate truly random bits
	Truly random bits
		typical random number generators aren't really random
		get randomness from outside world
			timing intervals, key presses, network packets, etc.
			use a few (low-order) bits from each sample
		may use physical processes
			radioactive decay
			lava lamps
			webcams (with lens cap on)
		current approach: leaky diodes
			built into newer Intel x86 CPUs
	Public-key cryptography
		instead of single shared secret, keys come in pairs
			one key for each pair distributed widely
			one key of each pair kept secret
			keys are inverses of each other, but not identical
	RSA algorithm for public key encryption
		private, public key pair consists of KR = (d,n), KU = (e,n)
			n = p x q (p and q are large prime numbers)
			e is a randomly chosen integer with GCD (d, (p-1)(q-1)) = 1
			d is an integer that (e x d) MOD ((p-1)x(q-1)) = 1
		p and q aren't published
		public key published and can be used to send a message
		to the private keys owner
		encryption and decryption are the same algorithm:
		E(KR, M) = M^e MOD n
		exponentiation slow, so not done with large messages
	One-way functions
		functions such that
			given formula for f(fx), easy to evaluate y = h(x)
			difficult to find collisions: two values with the same hash function
				weak collision resistance: given y, hard to find x such that f(x) = y
				strong collisions resistance: hard to find x and x' =/= x
				such that f(x) = f(x')
		often operate similar to encryption algorithms
		common algorithms
			MD5 - 128bit results
			SHA-1 - 160bit result
			SHA-256 - 256bit result
	Digital signatures
		digital signature computed by
			applying one-way hash function to original document
			encryption result with sender's private key
		receiver can verify by
			applying one-way hash function to received document
			decrypting signature using sender's public key
			comparing the two results
	Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
		uses public encryption
			facilitate key distribution
			allow messages to be sent to encrypted (public key)
			all messages to be sent from encrypted (private key)
		public key encryption is very slow
		use public key encryption to exchange a shared key
			shared key is relatively short (~128 bits)
			message encrypted using symmetric key encryption
		PGP can also be used to authenticate sender
			use digital signature and send messages as plaintext
	Diffie-Hellman Algorithm
		1. choose modulus p and base g (p is large prime and g is 
		small primitive root modulo of p)
		2. A sends B -> A=g^a mod p
		3. B sends A -> B=g^b mod p
		4. A computes s=B^a mod p
		5. B computes s=A^b mod p
		6. A and B both know same s (secret)
		share p,g,A,B but not a,b,s
	User authentication
		use authentication to identify
			something the user knows
			something the user has
			something the user is
	Authentication using passwords
		don't notify user of incorrect user name until after
		password entered
	Dealing with passwords
		passwords should be memorable
		passwords shouldn't be stored "in the clear"
		use hashing to hide "real" password
			- one-way function converting password to meaningless
			string of digits (UNIX password hash, MD5, SHA-1)
			- difficult to find another password that hashes
			to the same random-looking string
			- knowing the hashed value and hash function gives
			no clue to the original password
	Salting the passwords
		passwords can be guessed
			build table of all dictionary words, names, etc.
				table has each potential password in both plain and hashed form
			hacker gets copy of password file
				for each entry in password file see if password in above table
				if it is, password found
		use salt
			random characters added to password before hashing
			salt characters stored "in the clear"
			increase number of possible hash values for given password
	One-time passwords
		often implemented using one-way hash chain
		server is initialized with the list of passwords (or just n)
		on each login, server passes n to the client, which hashes
		the password n times and returns the answer
	Authentication using physical object
		magnetic card
			stores a password encoded in the magnetic strip
			allows for longer, harder to memorize passwords
		smart card
			card has secret encoded on it, but not externally readable
			remote computer issues challenge to card
			smart card computes response and proves it knows secret
	Two-factor authentication: OAuth
		additional "password" using a hardware token
		server and token share a (long) secret
		token computes
	Authentication using biometrics
		use basic body properties to prove identity
		examples
			fingerprints
			voice
			hand size
			retina patterns
			iris patterns
			facial features
		problems
			duplicates
			stealing original
	
2/24/16:
	Countermeasures
		limiting times someone can log in
		automatic callback at number prespecified
		limiting number of login attempts
		a database of all logins
		simple login name/password as trap
			security personnel notified when attacker bites
			variation: allow anyone to "log in", but
			don't let intruders do anything useful
	Trojan horses
		free program
			contains harmful code
			may do something useful
		altered version of utility program
			trick user into running program
	Login spoofing
		no difference between real and phony screens
		user logs into phony screen
			screen records user name and password
			screen print "login incorrect" and starts real screen
			user reattempts login
		solution: don't allow certain characters to be "caught"
	Logic bombs
		Programmer writes (complex) program
			ensure job security
			embeds logic "flaws" that are triggered if certain
			things aren't done
				enters password regularly
				adds a bit of code to fix things
				provides a certain set of inputs
				programmer's name appears on payroll
			if conditions not met
				program fails to work
				program does damage
			programmer can blackmail employer
	Trap doors
		user's access privileges coded into program
	Buffer overflow
		buffer overflow source of bugs in OSs
			most common in user programs that help OS do something
			may appear in "trusted" daemons
		exploited by modifying stack to
			return different address than intended
			included code that does something malicious
		accomplished by writing past the end of a buffer on the stack
	Generic security attacks
		request memory, disk space, tapes and just readable
		try illegal system calls
		start a login and hit DEL, RUBOUT, or BREAK
		try modifying complex OS structures
		try to do specified DO NOTs
		social engineering
			- convince a system programmer to add a trap door
			- beg admin's secretary (or other people) to help a poor
			user who forgot password
			- pretend you're tech support and ask random users for
			their help debugging a problem\
	Security flaws: TENEX password problem
		put password across page boundary
			first letter on resident page, others on non-resident page
		try different first letters
			if bad password before page fault, letter wrong
			if bad password after page fault, letter correct
		shift password up one character and repeat process
		guess password in O(kn) vs O(K^n) time for k different symbols
		and an n-symbol password
	Design principles for security
		system design should be public
		default should be no access
		check for current authority
		give each process least privilege possible
		protection mechanism should be
			simple
			uniform
			in lowest layers of system
		scheme should be psychologically acceptable
	Security in networked world
		external threat
			code transmitted to target machine
			code executed there, doing damage
		goals of virus writer
			quickly spread virus
			difficult to detect
			hard to get rid of
			optional: do something malicious
		virus: embeds itself into other code
		to reproduce and do its job
	Virus damage scenarios
		blackmail
		denial of service
		permanently damage hardware
		target competitors computer
			do harm / espionage
		intra-corporate tricks
			practical joke
			sabotage other officer's files
	How viruses work
		virus language
			assembly language - infect programs
			macro language - infect email and other documents
				runs when email reader / browser opens message
		inserted into another program
			use too called a "dropper"
			may also infect system code
		virus dormant until program executed
			then infect other programs
			eventually executes its payload
	How viruses find executable files
		recursive procedure that finds executable files on a UNIX system
		viruses can infect some or all files it finds
			infect all - wider spread
			infect some - harder to find
	Where viruses live in the program
		start of program
		end of program
		in program's free spaces
	Viruses infecting the operating system
		virus can capture interrupt and trap vector
		OS retakes keyboard vector
		virus notices and recaptures keyboard
	How do viruses spread
		virus placed where likely to be copied
			popular download site
		when copied
			infects programs
			may try to spread over LAN or WAN
		attach to innocent looking email
			when run, use mailing list to replicate
			may mutate slightly to avoid detection
	Hiding a virus in a file
		add virus to end of program
			problem file size changes
			solution use compression
		compressed infected program
			decompressor - for running executable
			compressor - for compressing newly infected binaries
			lots of free space
		virus easy to recognize
	Using encryption to hide a virus
		hide a virus by encrypting it
			vary the key in each file
			virus "code" varies in each infected file
			problem - lots of common code still in the clear
				compress / decompress
				encrypt / decrypt
		better: leave only decryptor and key in the clear
			less constant per virus
			use polymorphic code to hide these too
	Polymorphic viruses
		all code does same thing
		all use different machine code
		use "snippets" combined in random ways to hide code
	
2/26/16:
	How can viruses be foiled
		integrity checkers
			verify one-way function (hash) of program binary
			problem - virus can change that
		behavioral checks
			prevent certain program behavior
			problem - what about programs that can legitimately do these things
		avoid viruses by
			having good OS
			installing only trusted software
			using antivirus software
			not opening email attachments
		recovery from virus attack
			use a backup
			reboot from safe disk
	Worms vs. viruses
		viruses require other programs to run
		worms are self-running (separate process)
		the 1988 internet worms
			bootstrap to upload worm
			worm itself
			exploited bugs in sendmail and finger
			worm hid its existence
			next replicated itself on new systems
			brought the internet to a halt
	Mobile code
		run untrusted code without damaging system resources
		sandboxing
			memory divided into sandboxes
			accesses may not cross sandbox boundaries
			sensitive system calls not in sandbox
		interpreted code
			run interpreter rather than untrusted code
			interpreter doesn't allow unsafe operations
		signed code
			use cryptographic techniques to sign code
			check to ensure that mobile code signed by reputable organization
	Security in Java
		java is a type safe language
			compiler rejects attempts to misuse variable
		no real pointers
			can't simple create a pointer and dereference it as in C
		Checks included
			attempts to forge pointers
			violation of access restrictions on private class members
			misuse of variables by type
			generation of stack over/underflows
			illegal conversion of variables to another type
		applets can have specific operations restricted
			e.g., don't allow untrusted code to access full file system
	Protection
		security is mostly about mechanism
			how to enforce policies
			policies largely independent of mechanism
		protection is about specifying policies
			who accesses what
		specifications must be
			correct, efficient, and easy to use
	Protection domains
		list objects with permitted operations
		domains can share objects and permissions
	Protection matrix
		each domain has row in matrix
		each object has a column in matrix
		entry for <object, column) has permissions
	Objects in the protection matrix
		specify permitted operations on domains in the matrix
			domains may or may not be able to modify themselves
			domains can modify other domains
			some domain transfers permitted, other not
		allows flexibility in specifying domain permissions
	Access control lists
		protection domain
			user name
			group of users
			other
		access rights
			read
			write
			execute
			others
		no entry for domain => no rights for that domain
		OS checks permissions when access needed
	Access control lists in the real world
		UNIX file system
			access list for each file has exactly three domains on it
				user (owner)
				group
				others
			rights include read, write, execute: interpreted differently
			for directories and files
		AFS
			access lists only apply to directories - files inherit rights
			from the directory they are in
			access list may have entries on it with possible rights
				read, write, lock (for files in directory)
				lookup, insert, delete (for directories)
				administer (ability to add or remove rights from the ACL)
	Capabilities
		each process has a capability list
		list has on entry per object the process can access
			object name
			object permissions
		objects not listed are not accessible
		how are list secured
			kept in kernel
			cryptographically secured
	Cryptographically protected capability
		rights include generic rights (read, write, execute) and
			copy capability
			copy object
			remove capability
			destroy object
		server has a secret and uses it to verify capabilities presented to it
			or uses public-key signatures
	Protecting the access matrix
		OS must ensure that the access matrix isn't modified
		or accessed in an unauthorized way
		access control lists
			reading or modifying the ACL is a system call
			OS makes sure the desired operation is allowed
		capability lists
			can be handled the same way as ACLs
			- reading and modification by OS
			can be handed to processes and verified cryptographically
			- may be better for distributed systems where 
			capabilities can't be centrally checked
	Reference monitor
		all system calls go through the reference monitor for security checking
	Formal models of secure systems
		limited set of primitive operations on access matrix
			create/delete object
			create/delete domain
			insert/remove right
		primitives can be combined into protection commands
			may not be combined arbitrarily
		OS can enforce policies, but can't decide what policies are appropriate
	Bell-La Padula multilevel security model
		processes, objects have security level
		simple security property
			process at level k can only read objects at levels k or lower
		* property
			process at level k can only write objects at levels k or higher
		prevents information leaking from higher levels to lower levels
	Biba multilevel integrity model
		simple integrity principles
			a process can write only objects at its security level or lower
			no way to plant fake information at a higher level
		the integrity * property
			a process can read only objects at its security level or higher
			prevent someone from getting information from above and
			planting it at their level
		Biba in direct conflict with Bell-La Padula
			difficult to implement both at the same time
	Covert channels
		circumvent security model by using more subtle ways of passing information
		send data using side effects
			allocating resources
			using CPU
			locking file
			making small changes in legal data exchange
		very difficult to plus leaks in covert channels
	Covert channel using file locking
		assume n+1 files accessible to both A and B
		A sends information by
			locking files 0..n-1 according to an n-bit quantity to be conveyed to B
			locking file n to indicate that information is available
		B gets information by
			reading the lock state of files 0..n+1
			unlocking file n to show that information was received
		may not even need to access files (on some systems) to check lock status
	Steganography
		hide information in other data
		e.g., hide encrypted info into low order bits of color values in image file
